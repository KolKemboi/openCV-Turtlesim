# openCV-Turtlesim
controlling a turtrle bot using opencv

I wanted to see if my knowledge in opencv and ros2 could be bundled together and make a bot be controlled by user input.
And it did, to test it

clone the repo
colcon build
source the setup.bash from the install directory
run the command ros2 run cam_bot publisher
run the command ros2 run turltlesim turtlesim_node
run the command rqt_graph
